# Convex Polyhedron Intersection
This is an implementation of https://stackoverflow.com/questions/16389217/finding-the-intersection-of-two-3d-polygons .  
The algorithm takes two convex polyhedrons and outputs their intersection as a polyhedron.  
Currently, I suspect that such an intersection is always convex.  
Having this will help me with my Master's project. There, I can represent concave Polyhedrons as Tetrahedrons (which are always convex).
